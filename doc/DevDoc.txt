ToDo: As of 02.12.2009
======================

- [TODO] check and extend changes for default XSS prevention
  - check already implemented adaptions of rk in tx_ptlist_controller_list (see changelog below) - is this the right place?
  + IMPORTANT: make default XSS prevention configurable for a complete list (e.g. pt_list usage for CSV and PDF)
  - Alternative, but not-so-easy-to-implement: make default XSS prevention configurable for each dataDescriptionIdentifier via Typoscript) 
  - IMPORTANT: check for further default prevention actions
  - check new default XSS prevention behaviour of pt_mvc for unwanted effects, for 
    + breadcrumbs, 
    - bookmarks 
    - and other list features using tx_ptmvc_view::addItem()
    - filters (o = some open questions)
       o (mk) tx_ptlist_filter (Superclass for all filters)
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_options_base
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_options_explicit
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_options_group
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_datePager
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_datePicker
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_firstLetter
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_max
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_min
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_range
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_string
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_timeSpan
       - tx_ptlist_controller_filter_timeSpan2
    - Possibly dangerous parts concerning XSS-prevention:
       - tx_ptlist_filter::getFilterValueAsGetParameterString() generates getParameterStrings which are used as links in HTML-Source in other places without url-encoding
       - tx_ptlist_filter::breadcrumbAction() returns HTML-encoded value, so no rendering will be left :-)
   - IDEA: Introduce 2 new methods into tx_ptlist_filter: (1) getValueHtmlEncoded() (2) getValueUrlEncoded so we can centralize encoding purposes
- [TODO] SQL Injections
  - Possible SQL injection in tx_ptlist_controller_filter_options_base::getSqlWhereClauseSnippet()
    - Values passed to filter are not SQL-escaped. Should be escaped via mysql_real_escape_string()
- [TODO] FB: Crawlable/Cacheable
  - retrieve appendString from all components (pager, list) and not only from filterCollection
  - append appendString to all url (incl. sorting links in the list)
  - check / modify current filters and include the appendString to all urls that are generated
- (fb&mk) Refactor tx_ptlist_controller_list::init()
- (mk) Change TS for filters that use jQuery
- (mk) XML Export
- (mk) Change the way of how CSS for datepicker filter is included
- (mk) Change the way of how JS for datepicker filter is included
       At the moment, datepicker TS includes JS files "directly" from pt_jqueryui-extension.
       Think of mechanism to do this via JS manager (see pt_jqueryui DevDoc) 
- (mk) DatePicker and Timespan2 Filter don't work together because of dates from datepicker Filter
       influence Timespan's datepicker. Think of a better solution (--> jm)


XSS-Prevention Actions so far:
-----------------------------
+ (mk) CHG: tx_ptlist_filter::getView() adds TS configuration as 'filterconf'. As this values come from TS, no encoding is desired. Set to 'false' 





================================================================================
CHANGELOG
================================================================================

Version 0.0.4dev:
----------------

+ (fb) ADD: added manual in txt Format.

HINT: What are the text files used for?
Every SXW file has a pendant in text-file format. It should always reflect
the latest version of the SXW file it belongs to.  This is very useful
because txt files can be used for comparing changes while binary SXW
files can't.

How can I create txt files from an SXW file?
Just choose "Save as..." in OpenOffice.org and select "Text (.txt)" as
output format.
You can also use the script in trunk/update_txtfiles.sh to perform
mass-conversion of all documents. Just follow the steps explained in the
beginning of that script.

+ (nf) ADD: added a filter_integer
+ (fb) RFT: minor changes
+ (fb) ADD: added some setters in tx_ptlist_typo3Tables_list (They are needed if pt_list is extendend from other controllers and configuration should
	        be influenced by within the extending code. With this features you can easily have some "dedicated" controllers for special lists and add
	        individual configuration in a new flexform.
# (fb) ADD: added support for prev and next links (TODO: update documentation)
+ (fb) RFT: removed some empty lines

+ (mk) ADD: Possibility to structure a list by certain columns
+ (fb) ADD: apply stdWrap to dataDescription configuration's properties
+ (fb) ADD: string filter now supports "AND" queries: All search words will be concatenated with "and". The resulting expression
       must be in at least one of the data descriptions. To simulate a fulltext search you can create a special datadescription only used 
       by the string search by concatenating all fields you want to search in:
          Example: 
          plugin.tx_ptlist.listConfig.profileSearchResults.data.mySearchField {
                special = CONCAT(fe_users.tx_myext_firstname, '|', fe_users.tx_myext_lastname)
          }
          [...]
          plugin.tx_ptlist.listConfig.profileSearchResults.filters.defaultFilterbox.10 < plugin.tx_ptlist.alias.filter_string
          plugin.tx_ptlist.listConfig.profileSearchResults.filters.defaultFilterbox.10 {
            dataDescriptionIdentifier = mySearchField
            filterIdentifier = search
          }

  + filterbreadcrumb can be hidden now via css if no filter is active
  + changed my mail address
+ (rk) CHG: Addition of default XSS prevention for database data, adaption for new default XSS prevention of pt_mvc views 
  ***** IMPORTANT: unfinished - this may result in unwanted effects for existing pt_list implementations! *****
  + tx_ptlist_controller_list:
    + filterboxDefaultAction(): added third param "false" to addItem() of complete filterbox (do not filter HTML here since the complete filterbox is already rendered as HTML)
    + listDefaultAction(): added third param "false" to addItem() of $this->getColumnContents() (do not filter HTML here since the column contents may already be rendered as HTML (e.g. from Typoscript wraps) and the database data is already HTML filtered (see getColumnContents()))
    + getColumnContents(): sending all data description raw data through XSS filter now:
      $values[$dataDescriptionIdentifier] = tx_pttools_div::htmlOutput($itemObj[$dataDescriptionIdentifier]); 
  + ext_emconf.php: raised pt_tools dependency to version "0.4.2-", raised pt_mvc dependency to version "0.0.2-"
+ (mk) ADD: Documentation of how controllers in pt_list are processed and how filters are processed
+ (mk) ADD: tx_ptlist_filter: added possibilty to reset sorting of list by filter if configured in TS
   + (mk) ADD: Configuration key filters.<filter_name>.resetListSortingStateOnSubmit in TS
+ (rk) FIX: tx_ptlist_view_list_itemList_csv::sendHeader(): fixed assertion position, changed default download type to 'I'
+ (mk) ADD: (class.tx_ptlist_list.php) Added method "resetSortingParameters()" for resetting all sorting states of sortable columns
+ (mk) CHG: Items of pdf-view are now converted to utf-8 before XML generation
+ (mk) ADD: Manual for PDF rendering
+ (mk) ADD: PDF rendering is now almost generic
  + (mk) ADD: Added pdf-column width to column description

+ (mk) ADD: Added TS configuration for CSV filename and type of file handling for generated CSV files
+ (mk) ADD: Added some documentation for generating PDF files with pt_list
+ (mk) ADD: Added TS configuration for PDF filename and type of file handling for generated PDF files 
+ (fb) RMV: tx_ptlist_controller_stringGeneric is obsolete as it can be done with the tx_ptlist_controller_string filter using "dataDescriptionIdentifier = *"
+ (fb) CHG: filterBox configuration has changed. Class is no longer a property, but the value of the main key
    Before:
    10 {
        class < plugin.tx_ptlist.alias.filter_stringGeneric
        filterIdentifier = genericSearch
        label = Suche
        dataDescriptionIdentifier = 
    }
    
    Now: 
    10 < plugin.tx_ptlist.alias.filter_stringGeneric
    10 {
        filterIdentifier = genericSearch
        label = Suche
        dataDescriptionIdentifier = 
    }
+ (fb) ADD: dsn in listConfig and in renderUserFunction "fetchExternalData" can be a dsn string or a uid pointing to the tx_ptlist_databases table 
+ (fb) ADD: New table "tx_ptlist_databases"
+ (fb) CHG: renderUserFunctions only accepts numeric keys
+ (fb) CHG: tx_ptlist_renderer::cObj() renamed to tx_ptlist_renderer::cObject()
  + (fb) CHG: parameter for tx_ptlist_renderer::cObject() renamed from "cObj(.)" to "renderObj(.)"
